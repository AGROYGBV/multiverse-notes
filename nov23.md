## Unified Modeling Language
UML is a "language agnostic" way to plan, visualize, construct, and document systems, objects, and relationships for your program. Basically, a diagram in plain English to conceptualize your code. Three models we used today to plan our projects include: a Use Case Diagram, a Class Diagram, and a Sequence Diagram. Boxes represent nouns, arrows for verbs.

**Use Case Diagram:** a form of a *behavioral diagram* to map the users experience and interaction with the program. 

**Class Diagram:** a form of a *structural diagram* that shows in pseudo-code the structure of a system by mapping the system's classes, their attributes, methods, and the relationships among objects.

**Sequence Diagram:** sometimes called event diagrams or event scenarios. Is a form of an *interaction diagram* which is a subset of *behavioral diagrams.* Sequence diagrams can be considered a flow-chart for your system in regards to how objects communicate with each other to carry out functionality for the system.

Some sites we can use to make UML charts include: [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/), [ziteboard](https://ziteboard.com/), [PlantText](https://www.planttext.com/), [Draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/), and [Google Draw](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1kra93blZqVomXOoiBxk41r2SmTsYl1W9XAUcW608S3Q/edit). We used Excalidraw and Google Draw to plan our project and found Google Draw simple and familiar and therefore easy to begin with. 

I'll explore more UML examples to familiarize myself with the design, flow, and depth typically used in modeling. I'll also practice planning each project with at least one model before hand.
